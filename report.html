            <h1>My view and reflections on studying Web Development course </h1>
            <p>At the beginning of the module, I started with very little idea regarding html and CSS, not to even talk
                about java script. At first i found everything so confusing, probably because i was missing most of the
                online classes lol. But as we moved on I started picking up one or two knowledge and I had friends that
                understood better than me so I started reaching out to them gathering more knowledge and soon enough i
                was surprised how much i got to understand just from attending classes and reaching out to friends, and
                because of the tutor i think it was easier to understand due to his fun style of teaching.

                When it comes to the project AS1, it was proving difficult at first, i was just following the class
                lectures pacing, I had a lot of problems but I guess that's why i have classmates, so i had help from my
                mates to understand better and I watched a lot of videos lol, videos from the slides, videos from
                YouTube I pretty much tried to get all the knowledge I could get outside lectures. Am not even going to
                lie i messed up my work plenty times, Buh i guess it's all try and error, I think my hardest task was
                selecting a background, sounds funny but I was really stressed picking a background, I know it's the
                easiest but a wasted too much time selecting a background color.

                Overall, it was fun and stressful work on the website at the end I was able to make a simple website,
                hopefully the next assessment won't be as stressful lol. </p>
